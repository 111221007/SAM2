# SAM2
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) is a foundation model designed to address promptable visual segmentation in both images and videos. The model extends its functionality to video by treating images as single-frame videos. Its design, a simple transformer architecture with streaming memory, enables real-time video processing. A model-in-the-loop data engine, which enhances the model and data through user interaction, was built to collect the SA-V dataset, the largest video segmentation dataset to date. SAM 2, trained on this extensive dataset, delivers robust performance across diverse tasks and visual domains.

An experimental study on the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for video and image analysis across diverse applications. We assess SAM2’s segmentation and object detection capabilities in medical imaging, road safety & traffic monitoring. Experimental results indicate SAM2’s high segmenta- tion accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness, especially in healthcare and road safety contexts. In healthcare, SAM2 initially demonstrated limited anatom- ical segmentation capabilities in heart-related surgical videos, requiring more user interactions than anticipated and often not meeting the precision standards of tra- ditional models. However, after fine-tuning on a specialized medical dataset, it achieved its best performance to date. In road safety, SAM2 reliably identified key elements, such as emergency vehicles and potholes, under challenging traf- fic conditions. These findings underscore SAM2’s potential to streamline diverse applications, enhancing real-time analysis and operational simplicity. The paper concludes with insights into SAM2’s impact on video and image analysis workflows and directions for future research.
